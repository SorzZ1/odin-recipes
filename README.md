# Odin Recipes

## Introduction

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This project is part of the Odin Project curriculum, designed to teach the fundamentals of web development through hands-on practice. In this project, you will create a simple recipe website that showcases different recipes and their details.

## Project Description

The Odin Recipes project aims to provide a practical introduction to HTML and CSS. You will build a basic website consisting of multiple pages, each dedicated to a different recipe. Each recipe page will include:
- The name of the recipe
- A list of ingredients
- Step-by-step cooking instructions

By the end of this project, you will have demonstrated your ability to:
- Structure web pages using semantic HTML
- Link multiple pages within a website
- Use images and other media to enhance content

## Skills Demonstrated

### HTML
- Using semantic HTML elements to structure content
- Creating lists for ingredients and instructions
- Adding images to enhance recipe presentation
- Linking pages together using anchor (`<a>`) tags

## Self-Reflection (Post-Completion)

Upon completing this project, I have solidified my understanding of the following concepts:
- **HTML**: I learned how to use various HTML elements effectively to structure content and improve accessibility.
- **Web Development Workflow**: I practiced the essential workflow of planning, building, testing, and refining a web project.

This project has been an excellent starting point in my journey to becoming a proficient web developer. I look forward to building more complex projects and further enhancing my skills.
